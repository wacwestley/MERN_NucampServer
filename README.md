My introduction into Mongo, Express and Node through my bootcamp at Nucamp.
This project shows a working backend server with the ability to test out multiple requests.
We dive into Authentication through Passports and Tokens.
I use the platform Postman for mostly all my testing.
All dependancies are listed within my package.json file.
I also start a mongo server alongside separate from this project.
